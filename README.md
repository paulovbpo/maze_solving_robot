# maze_solving_robot
This is a project of a line follower robot for maze solving, using Arduino Uno, PID to control the track and algorithm to identify the options and choose one trajectory. 


Hardware: Arduino Uno, 5 IR sensors, 2 DC motors, H bridge, Bluetooth module, connecting wires and power supply.


Steps to build the robot:

1) Assembly the physical components;

2) Algorithm to follow the line, turn left, turn right and return;

3) PID control to correct the trajectory;

4) Algorithm to identify the options, and choose randomly one;

5) Algorithm to measure each segment of line;

6) Algorithm to know when achieve the target.
